## Overview

To all fans of Riot Games' popular                                                                                                  first-person shooter game **Valorant**:

A couple of months ago, I trained an AI model to predict the probability of winning the game based on the following features:
- Loadouts
- Rounds Won
- Map

## Data Collection

### Where did I get the data?
The data was scraped from [VLR.gg](https://www.vlr.gg/), a site from which I have obtained permission to collect data. After collection, the data underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its quality and suitability.

### Dataset Details
The dataset comprises information from over **10,000 best-of-three and best-of-five matches** across the T1, T2, and collegiate Valorant scenes. These matches include data from more than **500,000 rounds**, providing a solid foundation for machine learning analysis.

## Project Progress

### How did I take this project further?
This week, I took my project further by developing a full-stack web application, with **Next.js** powering the front end and **Flask** hosting the AI-driven REST API, which handles all prediction requests.

## Future Improvements

### What improvements would I consider?
- Add **Side Selection (Attack/Defense)** as a Model Feature
- Gather More Data from Non-Professional or Collegiate Scenes
